        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out
        walking once more. <u>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I 
        was carrying a very fragile treasure.</u> <span style="background-color: orange;">It seemed to me, even, that there was 
        nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the moonlight I looked at his pale
        forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I
        said to myself: <strong style="color: red;">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important
        is invisible..."</strong>
    </p>

        As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself,
        again: <strong style="color: red;">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here,
        is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose that shines through his whole
        being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</strong> And I felt him to be
        more fragile still. <u>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame 
        that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</u>
